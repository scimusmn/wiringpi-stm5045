# wiringpi-stm5045
A header-only wiringPi library for ST-M5045 compatible stepper motor drivers.

To build the example program: `g++ example.cpp -lwiringPi`

To build the documentation:
```bash
cd doc
doxygen Doxyfile
```

If you wish to use this in a new project, just copy stm5045.hpp 
into your project directory. You'll need to include wiringPi separately.
